# Code and Data for Twitter Sampling Effects Study

We release the code and data for the following paper.

## Crawling software package: [Twitter-intact-stream](https://github.com/avalanchesiqi/twitter-intact-stream)
I am still wrapping up all the analysis codes, but for the tool for constructing the complete Twitter filtered stream, please see the software page first.

Disclosure: We provide a pre-configured script to collect relevant tweets of COVID19. It can retrieve 25M tweets per day with an estimated 70% sampling rate.
